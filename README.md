# SherlockBench Clients

This codebase contains the clients for the SherlockBench AI benchmarking system.

There is a Python package for each LLM provider, sharing as much code as is
reasonable but allowing to accommodate the idiosyncrasies for each provider.

Essentially the clients are sitting in-between two APIs. The LLM provider's API
and the SherlockBench API.

## Main Website
The project homepage: https://sherlockbench.com

## Running
If you want to run this benchmark yourself, you will need:
- An account and API key for whichever LLM provider you want to use
- A computer to install Python and PostgreSQL on. Postgres is how it stores analytics for each run

General instructions follow. Alternatively you may watch this video for Ubuntu instructions: [Installing SherlockBench Client](https://youtu.be/8CdX0VheL5M).

Checkout this code.

Install these:
- PostgreSQL
  - server
  - client
  - libpq-dev
- Python3:
  - runtime
  - pip
  - virtualenv

Create a postgresql database and user.

Create a couple of config files:

A `resources/config.yaml` looks like this:

And a `resources/credentials.yaml` containing your db credentials and API keys:

api-keys:
  anthropic: ""
  openai: ""
  google: ""
  fireworks: ""
  xai: ""
  deepseek: ""
  mistral: ""
```

Running it should be essentially:
- make a virtualenv and activate it
- install sherlockbench into your virtualenv with `pip install -e .`
- run `alembic upgrade head` to create the database tables
- type the name of the provider entry-point to run the benchmark (see setup.cfg)

Here is an example of how to run it:
```
# list available problem-sets
sbench_list

# run the benchmark
sbench_anthropic Haiku-3.5 sherlockbench.sample-problems/easy3
```

If you want a breadown per problem, you will want to run multiple attempts per problem:
```
sbench_anthropic Haiku-3.5 sherlockbench.sample-problems/easy3 --attempts-per-problem 10

# summarize the attempts
summarize_attempts --run-ids b92c2ca4-6126-412e-a703-9d3991e99b77
```

## Database Analysis
There are two tables in the database;
- runs stores general information about the test run and it's results
- attempts stores the logs for the individual attempts and some metadata

There are also some views for convenience. These just show the most commonly used columns.
```
select * from runs_view;
select * from attempts_view;
```
